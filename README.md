# securemyworldbot
The new 911 bot. Companion bot for [securemyworld](https://github.com/satyapramodh/securemyworld)

What if 911 is a bot? what if uploading a picture, video of a crime/incident or texting for help or talking (audio) 
to the bot will trigger emergency services depending on the situation? We aim to solve just that.

Using the [Bot Framework](https://dev.botframework.com/), [Microsoft Cognitive Services](http://www.microsoft.com/cognitive-services) and [LUIS](http://luis.ai).
